        <h3>Following are the definitions you need in order to explore web development</h3>
        <dt><h4>HTML</h4></dt>
        <dd>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all websites. It<sup>,</sup>s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website. The HTML file contains all the content on the page, and it uses tags to denote different types of content.

            For example, you can use tags to create headline titles, paragraphs, bulleted lists, images, and so on. HTML tags by themselves do have some styles attached, but they are pretty basic, like what you would see in a Word document.</dd>
        <dt><h4>CSS</h4></dt>    
        <dd>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, lets you style that HTML content so it looks nice and fancy. You can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of your website however you want them to look. You can even create animations and shapes with CSS!

            There is a lot of depth to CSS, and sometimes people tend to gloss over it so they can move on to things like JavaScript. However, I can<sup>,</sup>t overestimate the importance of understanding how to convert a design into a website layout using CSS. If you want to specialize in front-end, it<sup>,</sup>s essential to have really solid CSS skills.</dd>
        <dt><h4>JavaScript</h4></dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, you can make your website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.

            For example, you can build a “Back to Top” button that when the user clicks it, they<sup>,</sup>ll scroll back up to the top of the page. Or you can build a weather widget that will display today<sup>,</sup>s weather based on the user<sup>,</sup>s location in the world.</dd>
